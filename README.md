# LearnNextJs

Personal sandbox for working through the official React and Next.js learning paths.

## Learn React (official docs)

- Completed all chapters of the `https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations` course (commits cover chapters 9 & 10).
- Code in this repo up to now reflects experiments and notes from that course.

## Next up: Learn Next.js

- Reusing the same repo while kicking off the `https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app` curriculum.
- Expect major resets/overhauls as the Next.js lessons progress.
- README will evolve to track milestones, resources, and any gotchas along the way.
